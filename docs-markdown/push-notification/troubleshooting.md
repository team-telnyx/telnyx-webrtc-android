# Push Notification Troubleshooting

This guide helps you troubleshoot common issues that prevent push notifications from being delivered in the Telnyx WebRTC Android SDK.

## Common Points of Failure

### 1. FCM Token Not Passed to Login

One of the most common issues is that the FCM token is not being passed correctly during the login process.

**How to verify:**
- Check your application logs to ensure the FCM token is being retrieved successfully
- Verify that the login message contains the FCM token
- Look for logs similar to: `FCM token received: [your-token]`

**Solution:**
- Make sure you're retrieving the FCM token as shown in the [App Setup](https://developers.telnyx.com/docs/voice/webrtc/android-sdk/push-notification/app-setup) guide
- Ensure the token is passed to the `connect()` method within the [TelnyxConfig](https://developers.telnyx.com/docs/voice/webrtc/android-sdk/config/txconfig) object (Ether Credential or Token)
- Verify that the token is not null or empty before passing it

### 2. Incorrect google-services.json Configuration

If your Firebase configuration file is incorrect or outdated, push notifications will not work properly.

**How to verify:**
- Check that the google-services.json file is in the correct location (app module root directory)
- Verify that the package name in the google-services.json matches your application's package name

**Solution:**
- Download a fresh copy of the google-services.json file from the Firebase Console
- Make sure you're using the correct Firebase project for your application
- Follow the [Portal Setup](https://developers.telnyx.com/docs/voice/webrtc/android-sdk/push-notification/portal-setup) guide to properly configure Firebase

### 3. Wrong Push Credential Assigned to SIP Credential

If the push credential is not correctly assigned to your SIP credential, the server won't know where to send push notifications.

**How to verify:**
- Log into the Telnyx Portal and check your SIP Connection settings
- Verify that the correct Android push credential is selected in the WebRTC tab

**Solution:**
- Follow the steps in the [Portal Setup](https://developers.telnyx.com/docs/voice/webrtc/android-sdk/push-notification/portal-setup) guide to properly assign the push credential
- Make sure you've selected the correct credential for your application

### 4. Incorrect Push Credential

If your push credential contains incorrect information, push notifications will fail.

**How to verify:**
- Check the push credential in the Telnyx Portal
- Verify that the server key JSON is correctly formatted and valid

**Solution:**
- Generate a new server key in the Firebase Console
- Update your push credential in the Telnyx Portal with the new key
- Test push notifications after updating the credential

### 5. Login Method Limitations

The way you authenticate with the Telnyx WebRTC SDK can affect push notification functionality.

**How to verify:**
- Check which login method you're using: SIP Connection, Generated Credential, or Token
- Refer to the [Dialing Registered Clients documentation](https://developers.telnyx.com/docs/voice/webrtc/sdk-commonalities#dialing-registered-clients)

**Solution:**
- Be aware that there are limitations on which registered clients can be called
- Test direct socket-connected calls before attempting push notification calls
- If using a token-based authentication, ensure the token has the necessary permissions

## Additional Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Check Firebase Console Logs**
   - Go to the Firebase Console > Your Project > Engage > Messaging
   - Check for any errors or failed deliveries

2. **Verify Android Manifest Configuration**
   - Ensure your AndroidManifest.xml has the correct permissions and service declarations
   - Check that your FirebaseMessagingService is properly registered

3. **Test with Firebase Test Notifications**
   - Use the Firebase Console to send a test notification to your device
   - This can help determine if the issue is with Firebase or with Telnyx

4. **Check Network Connectivity**
   - Ensure your device has a stable internet connection
   - Firebase Cloud Messaging requires network connectivity to receive notifications

5. **Verify Device Registration**
   - Make sure your device is properly registered with Firebase
   - Check that the FCM token is being refreshed when needed
